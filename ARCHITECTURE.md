# System Design

## Overview
This portfolio is engineered as a **Cloud-Native Serverless** application, prioritizing performance, security, and zero-maintenance infrastructure. It leverages the AWS ecosystem to deliver static assets globally with low latency.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Infrastructure (AWS Serverless)
- **Route 53:** Manages DNS resolution for `alexgafita.com`.
- **CloudFront:** Serves as the global Content Delivery Network (CDN) to cache assets at the edge.
- **S3 Standard:** Acts as the origin storage for the static HTML/CSS/JS generated by Next.js.

### 2. Edge Logic
- **CloudFront Functions:** A lightweight JavaScript function intercepts viewer requests to handle **URL Rewriting** (e.g., mapping `/projects` to `/projects.html`).
- *Trade-off:* Chosen over Lambda@Edge to eliminate "Cold Starts" and ensure <10ms latency for routing logic.

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates the deployment workflow.
- **Atomic Deploys:** The pipeline builds the Next.js artifact, syncs it to S3, and invalidates the CloudFront cache in a single workflow.
